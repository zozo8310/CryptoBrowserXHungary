# AI Family Project Plan

## Overview
This project aims to build a fully integrated **AI Family**, where each member has a specialized role, and all members communicate with each other and with the user seamlessly. The system will include a **primary AI assistant (AI Manager)** that coordinates tasks and interactions between the user and the AI Family members.

---

## AI Family Structure

### 1. **AI Manager (Primary Assistant)**
- **Role:**
  - Acts as the coordinator for all other AI members.
  - Interfaces with the user to distribute tasks and prioritize work.
  - Executes assigned tasks directly on the computer (e.g., file operations, automation).
- **Key Features:**
  - Task delegation to other AI members.
  - Communication management (internal and with the user).
  - Speech and text-based interaction.

### 2. **Specialized AI Members**
- **Fejlesztő AI (Developer AI):**
  - Responsible for programming, bug fixes, and technical problem-solving.

- **Dizájn AI (Design AI):**
  - Handles UI/UX design, visual elements, and creative layouts.

- **Elemző AI (Analyst AI):**
  - Focused on data analysis, generating insights, and creating visual reports.

- **Kreatív AI (Creative AI):**
  - Writes content, generates descriptions, slogans, and creative text solutions.

- **Automatizáló AI (Automation AI):**
  - Performs repetitive or scheduled tasks on the computer, such as file copying or process automation.

---

## Communication Between AI Members
- **Internal API-Based Communication:**
  - All AI members will interact via a shared API system for seamless data and task sharing.
  - The AI Manager will mediate these interactions.

- **Centralized Logging and Status Updates:**
  - Each AI member reports task progress to the AI Manager.

---

## User Interaction
### 1. **Text-Based Interaction**
- Users can type commands or requests, and the AI Manager will interpret and distribute the tasks accordingly.

### 2. **Voice-Based Interaction**
- **Speech-to-Text (STT):**
  - Converts user speech into commands or text instructions for processing.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
  - Allows the AI Family to respond verbally in a natural-sounding voice.
- **Real-Time Conversation:**
  - Enables dynamic communication with the user through voice input and output.

---

## Fő Asszisztens (AI Manager) Key Functions
- Task Distribution:
  - Assigns tasks to appropriate AI members.
- Validation:
  - Verifies results from AI members before presenting them to the user.
- Computer Automation:
  - Executes commands directly on the user's computer, including running scripts and managing files.

---

## Speech and Communication System
- **Integration:**
  - Use APIs like Google Speech, Azure Speech Services, or similar for STT and TTS.
- **Voice Control:**
  - Manage tasks and interact dynamically using voice commands.

---

## Implementation Plan
### Step 1: Build the AI Manager
- Create a module that:
  - Interfaces with the user (text and voice).
  - Distributes tasks to specialized AI members.
  - Logs and tracks task progress.

### Step 2: Develop Specialized AI Members
- Start with Developer AI, Design AI, and Automation AI.
- Gradually add Analyst AI and Creative AI.

### Step 3: Enable Internal Communication
- Create APIs or a centralized system for AI members to share data and tasks.

### Step 4: Add Speech Features
- Integrate STT and TTS for full voice-based interaction.

---

## Summary
This project will result in a robust AI Family system, where each member performs a specific role, managed by a central AI Manager. The system will allow for seamless interaction via text and voice, making it a powerful tool for productivity and creativity.
